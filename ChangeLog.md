# Paraffin Change Log #

## November 14, 2012, Version 3.61 ##
- Fixed a bug where .ParaffinMold files would be included in the output .WXS files.
- Finally broke down and started using ReSharper and carefully started fixing any warnings reported that would not destabilize the code. (Yes, I'm late to the ReSharper party)
- Fixed an link issue with the ReadMe.md file.
- Added this ChangeLog file.
